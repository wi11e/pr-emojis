My code review comments tend to come in a few categories. 
These are the emojis to indicate these categories:

:green_heart: heart: I love this

:clap: bravo: thanks for this ingenious, extra mile addition

:warning: notice: be aware of this bit of code

:question: question: can I ask something...?

:nail_care: style: code style could be improved here 

:haircut_man: nitpick: something I don't expect to change but I perhaps would have done differently

:shrug: shrug: I can see this could be improved, but the code can go without it

:bug: bug: something needs fixing here

:bomb: bomb: something about the architecture is wrong - we need to go back to the drawing board
